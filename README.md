# RNN-based-Chatbot-TensorFlow-Keras-
This project is a simple chatbot built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in TensorFlow/Keras.
The bot is trained on basic question-answer pairs and generates responses based on user input.

# âœ¨ Features
ðŸ§  RNN Model â†’ Uses an embedding layer + SimpleRNN to process user queries.
ðŸ“š Tokenization & Padding â†’ Converts text into sequences and ensures consistent input size.
ðŸŽ¯ Supervised Learning â†’ Learns from predefined questions and answers.
ðŸ’¬ Interactive Chat Loop â†’ Keeps responding until the user types "quit".
